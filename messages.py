    Welcome to Whisperer Bot!
    Type /help for more info about the commands
    
    This bot is still in development, so some features may not work as intended.
    Note that the bot can't join groups, so you'll have to talk to it in private.
    
    /setlang command is, at the moment, disabled. The bot will use no preferred language by default, so automatic language detection will be used.
    
    /viewlang shows all the supported languages and the current language. At the moment, the bot will not use any of the supported languages, so this menu is, at the moment, useless.
    
    Please enjoy the bot and report any bugs to @Fosanz. Thank you!
